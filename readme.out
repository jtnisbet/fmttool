notes etc

remake the fmttool and make it more gooder.

the idea is to provide the user with options for format method.
i.e.
-i 32
means format it as a 32 bit integer

have a default mode which formats in common ways
have a -long mode which tries to format in all ways
support user pipe and stuff too.
can you do: echo "45" | fmttool -i 32
so can we part both the | and the command args?

--------
maybe test istream version of some stuff...i.e. delimiters and junk.

fill out the help text.  -b option needs explaining so its more clear.

then I think I'm done really...
