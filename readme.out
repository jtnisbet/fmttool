notes etc

remake the fmttool and make it more gooder.

the idea is to provide the user with options for format method.
i.e.
-i 32
means format it as a 32 bit integer

have a default mode which formats in common ways
have a -long mode which tries to format in all ways
support user pipe and stuff too.
can you do: echo "45" | fmttool -i 32
so can we part both the | and the command args?

--------
things are going well.
doing the hex input for negatives as the moment.
fixed the 4 byte version...need to update the others I think.

then after that, I guess work on the binary or ascii options?
given a string of letters, show the hex bytes of the ascii chars
given a hex input number, treat it as an array of chars and show the ascii
   char string of that data.

going back to some code cleanup first.
done..but want to clean up.
make a compile time check instead of runtime for bad type support.
also rework that if statement etc.
double check all types are correct.  add testcases for these negatives for hex etc.
