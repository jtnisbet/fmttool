notes etc

remake the fmttool and make it more gooder.

the idea is to provide the user with options for format method.
i.e.
-i 32
means format it as a 32 bit integer

have a default mode which formats in common ways
have a -long mode which tries to format in all ways
support user pipe and stuff too.
can you do: echo "45" | fmttool -i 32
so can we part both the | and the command args?

--------
things are going well.

-a hello

this means, format this string as if the characters are ascii characters.
so, it will show the ascii code for h? e? etc? as hex bytes?

-b 0x4546

This means, format these bytes as if this is the binary representation in hex.

-b 1234

this is not a valid input.  I could read it as a number, then I already have
number formatting.
