notes etc

remake the fmttool and make it more gooder.

the idea is to provide the user with options for format method.
i.e.
-i 32
means format it as a 32 bit integer

have a default mode which formats in common ways
have a -long mode which tries to format in all ways
support user pipe and stuff too.
can you do: echo "45" | fmttool -i 32
so can we part both the | and the command args?
