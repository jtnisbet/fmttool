notes etc

remake the fmttool and make it more gooder.

the idea is to provide the user with options for format method.
i.e.
-i 32
means format it as a 32 bit integer

have a default mode which formats in common ways
have a -long mode which tries to format in all ways
support user pipe and stuff too.
can you do: echo "45" | fmttool -i 32
so can we part both the | and the command args?

--------
got the basic interface done.
now I'm focussing on the format itself.
say you have -i 32 -i 64 55 99

this means we format the 55 and the 99.
but each format may yield multiple columns. for example:
55 0x0000000000000055  ==> 64 bit output
55 0x00000055          ==> 32 bit output

so do you display:
55 0x00000055 0x0000000000000055

this will need some work for this.
and also, we need to figure out how to show titles as well to go with this.

what about signed or unsigned?
can we show what the overflowed number might look like?  or the negative number?
maybe my option should be i for signed int and u for unsigned int

-------------

so for signed vs unsigned...later I'll add a -u.
It might be able to share the same fmt type as int_type though, but not sure.

Also, I was thinking about a template based format.
like format<uint32_t>(std::string value)
..however the problem is that each type has different rules I think.
So I would have custom code and basically need to do template specialization
for each one. so not much point
