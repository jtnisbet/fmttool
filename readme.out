notes etc

remake the fmttool and make it more gooder.

the idea is to provide the user with options for format method.
i.e.
-i 32
means format it as a 32 bit integer

have a default mode which formats in common ways
have a -long mode which tries to format in all ways
support user pipe and stuff too.
can you do: echo "45" | fmttool -i 32
so can we part both the | and the command args?

--------
got the basic interface done.
now I'm focussing on the format itself.
say you have -i 32 -i 64 55 99

this means we format the 55 and the 99.
but each format may yield multiple columns. for example:
55 0x0000000000000055  ==> 64 bit output
55 0x00000055          ==> 32 bit output

so do you display:
55 0x00000055 0x0000000000000055

this will need some work for this.
and also, we need to figure out how to show titles as well to go with this.

what about signed or unsigned?
can we show what the overflowed number might look like?  or the negative number?
maybe my option should be i for signed int and u for unsigned int

-------------

so for signed vs unsigned...later I'll add a -u.
It might be able to share the same fmt type as int_type though, but not sure.

Also, I was thinking about a template based format.
like format<uint32_t>(std::string value)
..however the problem is that each type has different rules I think.
So I would have custom code and basically need to do template specialization
for each one. so not much point

----------------

say you have -i 32 -i 64 55 99
the "firstOfType" logic is broken.
say you want to format both 32 and 64.
say that its out of range for 32, but is okay for 64.
the columns are:

base 10 value    hex value
-------------    ---------

but the idea was that you don't need to display the base 10 value twice if its the same.
however, what if you get out of range on the first.  you still want to show it for the second.

thus, we need a feedback from the format to advise on the first of type logic.

no, for now, lets get rid of this idea.
instead, always show the column for first of type. 
--------------------
for now, code compiles.  I got the int8 formatter coded..but I haven't displayed the results I don't think?
debug this and see what it looks like etc.
./fmttool -i 8 6

I get:
660

so..something strange.  do the debugging.  maybe code up the width adjuster as well so that it adds a space
or two between columns
